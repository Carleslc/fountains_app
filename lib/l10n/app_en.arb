The location of the fountains may not be correct, the fountains may not be operational or may not have water, and we cannot ensure that the water is safe to drink.\n\nIf you find any errors or outdated information, we encourage you to report it in the fountain information to help the application display the most accurate data possible about each fountain at any given time.\n\nThe application is not affiliated with or related to any municipalities, responsible companies, manufacturers, or distributors of the water fountains.
